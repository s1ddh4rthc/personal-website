        My name is Siddharth, and I am a junior at the University of Maryland - College Park pursuing towards 
        a B.S. in Computer Science. 
        
        I am interested in Machine Learning, and I love working on projects that lay at the intersection of
        finance and computer science, as showcased by my work at  
        <a href="https://www.github.com/apexfund" className="underline"> Apex Quant</a>.
      </p>
    </div>
